# Install script for bringing up and securing an nginx + commandbox server

After bringing a new server online, run the following commands (with sudo or as root) to kick things off

```bash
cd /root
git clone https://github.com/letskillowen/ubuntu-nginx-commandbox.git
cd ./ubuntu-nginx-commandbox
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```
